# Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer

The [Udacity Self-Driving-Car Nano-Degree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013)
gives a stepwise introduction into the technical requirements of a self-driving-car. For
each fundamental part a project had to be implemented. Fundamental parts are Computer vision,
Sensor Fusion, Localization, Pathfinding, PID-control, which were implemented in Python or C++.
